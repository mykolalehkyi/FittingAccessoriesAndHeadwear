# MLight-VTON Virtual Fitting Room
Hi, I am Mykola Lehkyi and I am a Software Engineer. 
## Overview
MLight-VTON is an augmented reality-based virtual fitting room application designed to enhance online shopping experiences by allowing users to try on accessories and headwear virtually. The application uses cutting-edge neural network technologies and AR to simulate realistic fittings with dynamic shadows, lighting, and occlusions using a web browser.

## Features
- Real-time Fitting: Users can try on accessories and headwear in real-time, with support for dynamic adjustments based on user movements.
- 3D Visualization: Incorporates advanced 3D rendering techniques to ensure accessories are displayed with realistic shadows and lighting, enhancing the user experience.
- Cross-platform Compatibility: Designed to work seamlessly across various devices and platforms, requiring only a web browser.
- Low Hardware Requirements: Optimized to run smoothly with minimal CPU and GPU usage, making it accessible on standard consumer devices.
- 3D Lighting and Shadows: Provides a realistic simulation of how accessories and headwear would look with proper lighting and shadows.
- High Frame Rate: Ensures smooth and seamless interaction with a high number of frames per second.
- Web-Based: Accessible from any device with a web browser, requiring minimal CPU and GPU resources.
- Reduced Occlusions: Minimizes issues with occlusions to improve the accuracy of the fitting process.
- TensorFlow.js Integration: Supports further enhancements with trained TensorFlow.js models for improved fabric deformation and body segmentation.

## Usage
- Starting the Application: Open your web browser and navigate to the hosted URL.
- Selecting Accessories/Headwear: Choose an item from the available accessories to try on.
- Virtual Fitting: The selected item will be virtually placed on your image through the webcam feed. Adjust your position as needed to see the item from different angles.
- Capture & Share: Capture the images of your fittings and share them directly on social media platforms.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- AR Engine: Three.js, TensorFlow.js for neural network operations
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js for handling server-side operations
